ðŸš¢ Analyzing the Titanic Dataset: A Data Science Journey ðŸ“Š

The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in data science, offering great insights into survival patterns based on factors like age, fare, and class. I recently worked on an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and built machine learning models to predict survival chances. Here's a quick breakdown of my approach:

ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values in age using mean imputation

Standardized fare and age for better model performance

Encoded categorical features like sex and embarked

ðŸ”¹ Feature Selection

Used SelectKBest (Chi-Square test) to pick the most relevant features for survival prediction

ðŸ”¹ Model Training & Evaluation

Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models

Achieved 74% accuracy, but I'm exploring XGBoost for better results!

ðŸ“‰ Next Steps:

Hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance

Visualizing feature importance to better understand survival patterns

Experimenting with deep learning approaches

Data science is all about iteration and continuous learning! ðŸš€ Have you worked with the Titanic dataset? Share your insights!
